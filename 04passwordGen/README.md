# React Password Generator Project

This project demonstrates my practical understanding of **useState, useEffect, and useCallback** by building a fully functional **password generator** in React. **useState** is used to manage the password value and user-selected options such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. **useEffect** is used to automatically regenerate the password whenever any option or dependency changes, ensuring the UI always stays in sync with the selected settings. **useCallback** is applied to memoize the password generation function, preventing unnecessary re-creation of the function and improving performance. The project also includes a **copy button** that copies the exact generated password to the clipboard, reinforcing real-world React patterns and efficient state-driven UI updates as part of my learning journey.

* useState → managing password and options
*useEffect → regenerating the password on dependency changes
*useCallback → optimizing the generator function
