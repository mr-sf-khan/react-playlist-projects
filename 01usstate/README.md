# React useState Counter Project

This project demonstrates my understanding of the **useState hook in React** by building a simple counter component with **two buttons to increase and decrease the count**. I implemented **minimum and maximum limits** to restrict the counter value, ensuring the buttons stop working once the defined limit is reached. The **initial value and limits are passed using props**, which helped me understand how state and props work together in a real React component. This project is part of my React learning journey and focuses on practical, hands-on state management.
