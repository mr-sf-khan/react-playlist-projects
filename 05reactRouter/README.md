# GitHub User Info App

This is a small React practice project built to strengthen my understanding of **React Hooks**, **component structure**, and **API data handling**. The application fetches real-time user data from the GitHub public API and displays information such as follower count. The focus of this project is correct hook usage, clean routing structure, and simple UI styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Hooks & Concepts Used

* `useState` – to store and manage GitHub user data
* `useEffect` – to fetch API data when the component mounts
* React Router v6 – for routing and layout management
* GitHub Public API – for fetching live user information
* Tailwind CSS – for basic styling and layout
