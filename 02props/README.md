# React Props Practice Project

This project demonstrates my understanding of **props in React** by creating a reusable **card/box component structure** where names and other related information are dynamically passed and updated using props. By changing data through props instead of hardcoding values, I learned how to make components reusable, flexible, and easier to maintain. This project helped me clearly understand the role of props in component communication and dynamic UI rendering, and it is part of my hands-on React learning journey.
