# React Props Background Changer Project

This project is focused on **brushing up my React props skills** by building a **background color changer component**. I created a reusable structure where background colors and related values are passed through **props**, allowing the UI to update dynamically based on the received data. This helped me strengthen my understanding of props-driven rendering, component flexibility, and clean data flow between components, making my React components more reusable and maintainable as part of my learning journey.
